  <h1>100 Days of UI Implementation Challenge</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">By William Nguyen</p>

  <p class="info">
    I recently stumbled upon Paul Flavius Nechita's <a href="http://www.100daysui.com">100 Days of UI</a> challenge. For 100 days, he created 100 amazing UI's with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. As a developer working on improving his front-end development skills, I decided to try my hands at implementing Paul's 100 UIs in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

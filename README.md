# 100 Days of UI Implementation

I recently stumbled upon Paul Flavius Nechita's [100 Days of UI](http://www.100daysui.com) challenge. For 100 days, he created 100 amazing UI's with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. As a developer working on improving his front-end development skills, I decided to try my hands at implementing Paul's 100 UIs in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
